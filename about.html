    <h2>About</h2>
    <h4>A: Cultural heritage (where I come from?) </h4>
    <p>I’m Vietnamese American. I was born and raised in the USA, but my parents are from Vietnam. I don’t particularly have a strong connection to Vietnam as a home country, but more so a place that reminds me of my parents and family. There’s something about the common mannerisms and  atmosphere of the country that reminds me of family.  On the other hand, I don't feel especially connected to America either. I struggle to relate to typical Americans and even third or second generation Americans sometimes. I find a lot of comfort around other people like me, who come from immigrant households (especially Asian ones) and are the first generation born in the USA. It really comes down to a common understanding of everyday habits and personal struggles, such as the typical similar reverence for elders and heritage, as well as the struggles and experiences that come from adapting to American society and breaking free of history.</p>
    <h4>B: Personal Identity (How to define myself?) </h4>
    <p>To be honest, I'm not exactly sure how I'd define myself. I'm the kind of person that defines themselves by the things they do and the things I have passion for. I love to create things and see people enjoy them, but I wouldn't say I'm an artsy or crafts-y person. It's part of why I'm pursuing a UX/UI career path. I'm also someone who loves food and making it. I love to eat things and I regularly cook all kinds of cuisines for myself. I like to bake bread every once in a while, and I have my own collection of (unfortunately) expensive kitchen tools and cutlery. I'm also a tech enthusiast, and I like to have specialized tools for things. Things like custom keyboards, audio equipment, photography, computers, etc. I personally appreciate that the things I use and touch everyday are both pretty looking but highly functional. </p>
    <h4>C: How do you see your cultural heritage and personal identity evolving and impacting your design work? </h4>
    <p>I was brought up in a stereotypical Asian household. The kind that places results and achievement above all else. Naturally, that left me wanting more excitement in the things I did. I wanted more of the things that didn't show in the results, things that were fun or entertaining. On top of that, I developed a feel for ergonomics through my personal hobbies, such as keyboards and music. As a result of the results-focused mindset I grew up with, I've noticed that I'm not one for flashy or particularly exciting design work, and I tend to lean towards subtle and more elegant but functional designs. It's hard for me to kick the habit of keeping things true to their function. The other side of me tries to go against that, though, so I often try to incorporate functional elements into my designs, such as barcodes, printing lines, and functional typefaces. </p>
    <h4>D: How do you think Web 3.0 will impact the field of graphic design and interaction design and how you will adapt to these changes?</h4>
    <p>From what I read, Web 3.0 is the third iteration of the web, defined by open technologies like blockchain and immersive experiences like the metaverse. If I'm understanding this correctly, the field of graphic and interaction design will grow exponentially. By decentralizing the web, interacting with the internet will fundamentally require new and deeper levels of interaction design. Currently, companies create their content with their own design rules and philosophy. An individual may interact with multiple social media platforms, with user and login information for each platform. With Web 3.0, you could have a single, decentralized identity online, with your information that you share on a case by case basis for each platform. To put this into an analogy, you could say that your information would be the key to a specific platform's keyhole. With Web 3.0 designers have to account for a keys that change shape, and locks that can fit any shape key. </p>
