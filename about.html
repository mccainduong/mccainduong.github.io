    <h2>About</h2>
    <h4>A: Cultural heritage (where I come from?) </h4>
    <p>I'm a Vietnamese American, born and raised in the USA, but my parents are from Vietnam. Vietnam isn't exactly my homeland, but it's more like a place that reminds me of my parents and family. There's something about the way people act and the general atmosphere in Vietnam that makes me feel connected to my roots.I don't feel super attached to the USA either. I sometimes struggle to relate to typical Americans, including second or third-generation ones. I feel most comfortable around people like me, who come from immigrant families (especially Asian ones) and are the first generation born here. It's because we get each other's daily routines, the challenges we face, and the values we share. Stuff like respecting our elders and our heritage, as well as dealing with the ups and downs of adapting to American life while still honoring our history.</p>
    <h4>B: Personal Identity (How to define myself?) </h4>
    <p>Honestly, I find it somewhat challenging to define myself. I tend to identify myself through my interests and passions. I have a deep love for creating things and deriving satisfaction from seeing others appreciate them. However, I wouldn't classify myself as particularly artsy or crafty. This inclination is a significant reason why I've chosen to pursue a career in UX/UI design. I also have a strong affinity for food, not just in savoring it but in the art of preparing it as well. I take pleasure in trying various cuisines and often prepare meals from different cultural backgrounds. Occasionally, I bake bread, and I've accumulated a collection of kitchen tools and cutlery, which, regrettably, tend to be on the pricey side. Additionally, I consider myself a tech enthusiast. I appreciate having specialized tools for various purposes, whether it's custom keyboards, audio equipment, photography gear, or computers. What I personally value is that the items I interact with daily not only have an aesthetic appeal but also have high functionality.</p>
    <h4>C: How do you see your cultural heritage and personal identity evolving and impacting your design work? </h4>
    <p>I was raised in a traditional Asian household that prioritized results and achievement above all else. This upbringing left me looking for more excitement and enjoyment in my pursuits, something more than numbered results. Simultaneously, I grew an appreciation for ergonomics through personal hobbies like keyboards and music. As a product of this results-oriented mindset, I've observed that I tend to gravitate towards designs that are understated, elegant, and above all, functional, rather than flashy or overtly stimulating. My inclination is rooted in a strong commitment to preserving the core functionality of things. Consequently, I often endeavor to incorporate functional elements into my designs, such as barcodes, printing lines, and purpose-driven typefaces.</p>
    <h4>D: How do you think Web 3.0 will impact the field of graphic design and interaction design and how you will adapt to these changes?</h4>
    <p>As I understand it, Web 3.0 represents the third evolution of the internet, characterized by open technologies like blockchain and immersive concepts such as the metaverse. This transformation is poised to have a profound impact on the field of graphic and interaction design. By decentralizing the web, it necessitates entirely new and more intricate levels of interaction design. At present, companies create their content within the confines of their unique design principles and philosophies. Individuals often find themselves interacting with multiple social media platforms, each requiring its own set of user credentials and login procedures. In contrast, Web 3.0 envisions a scenario where you possess a single, decentralized online identity. You selectively share your information on a case-by-case basis with each platform, likened to using your information as the key to various platform "keyholes." To put it simply, in a Web 3.0 environment, designers must adapt to accommodate keys that can change in shape and locks that can accept keys of varying shapes.</p>
